phpBB3 Mods and Classes
==================

These are open source mods and classes that I have created over the years.

There are actually many more that have never seen the public.
They will be added here as well when I get the time.


Each mod has its own branch.

NOTE: The RSS Mod is depreciated since phpBB3 now has RSS built in.


None of these mods are ready for install unless you know what you are doing.

IE: no instructions at this point and some have not been tested in a while.
